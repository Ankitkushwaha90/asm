General-Purpose Registers in x86 and x86_64: EAX, EBX, ECX, EDX
The general-purpose registers are versatile and are used for various operations like arithmetic, data movement, and function calls. Each register has a specific historical or traditional use, although modern compilers and assembly programmers use them flexibly.

Register	Purpose/Convention
EAX/RAX	Accumulator for arithmetic and function return values.
EBX/RBX	Base register, often used for addressing memory.
ECX/RCX	Counter register, traditionally used for loops and string operations.
EDX/RDX	Data register, often used in division, I/O operations, and as an extension of EAX.
Note: The E prefix in registers like EAX indicates the 32-bit extended version of the older 16-bit registers (e.g., AX). In x86_64, the R prefix is used for the 64-bit versions (e.g., RAX).

Detailed Explanation with Examples
1. EAX/RAX: Accumulator Register
Commonly used for arithmetic operations and to store function return values.
Example: Adding Two Numbers

asm
Copy
Edit
section .text
    global _start

_start:
    mov eax, 10         ; Load 10 into EAX
    add eax, 20         ; Add 20 to EAX (EAX = EAX + 20)
    
    ; Exit program
    mov eax, 60         ; sys_exit
    xor edi, edi        ; Exit code 0
    syscall
EAX Result: After the add instruction, EAX contains 30.
2. EBX/RBX: Base Register
Often used as a pointer to memory (base register) in memory addressing modes.
Example: Accessing an Array in Memory

asm
Copy
Edit
section .data
    array db 10, 20, 30, 40     ; An array of bytes

section .text
    global _start

_start:
    mov ebx, array        ; Load the address of `array` into EBX
    mov al, [ebx]         ; Load the first element (10) into AL
    add al, [ebx+1]       ; Add the second element (20) to AL (AL = 10 + 20)

    ; Exit program
    mov eax, 60           ; sys_exit
    xor edi, edi          ; Exit code 0
    syscall
Result: AL contains 30 (10 + 20).
3. ECX/RCX: Counter Register
Used for counting in loops or as a counter for string operations (e.g., REP MOVSB).
Example: Loop Using ECX

asm
Copy
Edit
section .text
    global _start

_start:
    mov ecx, 5            ; Set counter to 5

loop_start:
    dec ecx               ; Decrement ECX by 1
    cmp ecx, 0            ; Compare ECX with 0
    jne loop_start        ; Jump if ECX is not zero

    ; Exit program
    mov eax, 60           ; sys_exit
    xor edi, edi          ; Exit code 0
    syscall
Explanation: The loop runs 5 times, decrementing ECX each time.
4. EDX/RDX: Data Register
Used in multiplication, division, or I/O operations. It often works as an extension to EAX for 64-bit results.
Example: Multiplying Two Numbers

asm
Copy
Edit
section .text
    global _start

_start:
    mov eax, 5            ; Load 5 into EAX
    mov ebx, 4            ; Load 4 into EBX
    mul ebx               ; Multiply EAX by EBX (EAX = EAX * EBX)

    ; Exit program
    mov eax, 60           ; sys_exit
    xor edi, edi          ; Exit code 0
    syscall
Result: EAX contains 20 (5 * 4), and EDX holds the high 32 bits of the result (if any).
Extended Use in x86_64
64-Bit Registers:

EAX becomes RAX, EBX becomes RBX, and so on, for 64-bit operations.
Example:
asm
Copy
Edit
mov rax, 123456789012345   ; Load 64-bit value into RAX
add rax, 987654321098765   ; Add another 64-bit value
Function Calling Convention (System V ABI):

RAX: Return value.
RCX: Fourth argument in function calls.
Example: Passing Arguments to a Function

asm
Copy
Edit
section .text
    global _start

_start:
    mov rdi, 10           ; First argument (10)
    mov rsi, 20           ; Second argument (20)
    call add_numbers      ; Call the function

    ; Exit program
    mov eax, 60           ; sys_exit
    xor edi, edi          ; Exit code 0
    syscall

add_numbers:
    add rdi, rsi          ; RDI = RDI + RSI
    mov rax, rdi          ; Store result in RAX (return value)
    ret                   ; Return
Result: RAX contains 30.
