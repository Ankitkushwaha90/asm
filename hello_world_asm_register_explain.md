# Assembly Language for x86_64 Architecture

Assembly language for x86_64 is a low-level programming language designed for the 64-bit x86 architecture, used in most modern processors (Intel and AMD). It provides direct control over hardware and is closely tied to the architecture's instruction set.

## x86_64 Architecture Overview

The x86_64 architecture is an extension of the earlier 32-bit x86 architecture, enabling support for 64-bit computing while maintaining backward compatibility with 32-bit programs.

### Key Features of x86_64:

#### Registers

- General-purpose registers are 64 bits wide.
- Registers now have extended versions (e.g., `rax` instead of `eax`).
- Examples of general-purpose registers:
  - **RAX, RBX, RCX, RDX:** For arithmetic and general use.
  - **RSI, RDI:** Used for string operations and function arguments.
  - **RSP:** Stack pointer.
  - **RBP:** Base pointer (used for stack frames).
  - **R8-R15:** Additional registers introduced in x86_64.

#### Memory Addressing

- Supports 64-bit addresses.
- Addressing modes include immediate, register, and memory-based (e.g., `[rax+rbx]`).

#### Calling Conventions (System V ABI on Linux)

- Function arguments are passed in registers:
  - **RDI, RSI, RDX, RCX, R8, R9**.
- Return value is stored in **RAX**.
- The stack is aligned to 16 bytes for function calls.

#### Instruction Pointer

- The **RIP** register stores the current instruction address, enabling position-independent code (used in shared libraries).

#### Segment Registers

- Used for compatibility with older x86 features but rarely used directly in x86_64.

#### Faster Execution

- Wider registers allow more efficient computations and larger address spaces.

## Structure of an x86_64 Assembly Program

An assembly program typically consists of the following sections:

### Data Section

Holds constants or initialized variables.
```asm
section .data
message db "Hello, World!", 0xA   ; String with a newline
msg_len equ $ - message           ; Length of the string
```

### BSS Section

Holds uninitialized variables.
```asm
section .bss
buffer resb 64                    ; Reserve 64 bytes
```

### Text Section

Contains the code to be executed.
```asm
section .text
global _start                     ; Entry point of the program
```

## Simple Example: Print "Hello, World!" (Linux)

Here's a simple assembly program to print "Hello, World!" using the Linux system call interface.

### Code: hello.asm
```asm
section .data
    message db "Hello, World!", 0xA      ; String with newline
    msg_len equ $ - message              ; Calculate length of the string

section .text
    global _start

_start:
    ; sys_write: write to stdout
    mov rax, 1           ; System call number for sys_write
    mov rdi, 1           ; File descriptor (stdout)
    mov rsi, message     ; Address of the message
    mov rdx, msg_len     ; Length of the message
    syscall              ; Invoke system call

    ; sys_exit: exit the program
    mov rax, 60          ; System call number for sys_exit
    xor rdi, rdi         ; Exit code 0
    syscall              ; Invoke system call
```

### Steps to Assemble and Run (Linux x86_64)

1. **Assemble the Code:** Use `nasm` to assemble the program into an object file:

   ```bash
   nasm -f elf64 hello.asm -o hello.o
   ```

2. **Link the Object File:** Link the object file into an executable:

   ```bash
   ld hello.o -o hello
   ```

3. **Run the Program:** Execute the program:

   ```bash
   ./hello
   ```

### Output:

```
Hello, World!
```

## System Calls in x86_64

In Linux, system calls are made using the `syscall` instruction. Arguments are passed in specific registers:

| Register | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| RAX      | System call number |
| RDI      | First argument |
| RSI      | Second argument |
| RDX      | Third argument |
| R10      | Fourth argument |
| R8       | Fifth argument |
| R9       | Sixth argument |

### Example: `sys_write`

To write a message to the console:
- **rax = 1** (sys_write),
- **rdi = 1** (stdout),
- **rsi = address of the message**, 
- **rdx = length of the message**.

## x86_64 Assembly Program: Add Two Numbers

### Code: add_numbers.asm
```asm
section .text
    global _start

_start:
    ; Load numbers into registers
    mov rax, 10         ; Load 10 into RAX
    mov rbx, 20         ; Load 20 into RBX

    ; Add the numbers
    add rax, rbx        ; RAX = RAX + RBX

    ; Exit the program
    mov rax, 60         ; System call for exit
    xor rdi, rdi        ; Exit code 0
    syscall
```

## Features of x86_64 Architecture

### 64-bit Registers

- Increased register width improves performance for large data processing.

### Extended Registers

- Additional registers (**R8-R15**) provide more flexibility in computations.

### Larger Memory Addressing

- Up to 16 exabytes of virtual memory, although current implementations use only a portion of it.

### Efficient Calling Conventions

- Passing function arguments in registers reduces stack usage and improves performance.

### Backward Compatibility

- Fully supports 32-bit x86 programs, making it versatile for legacy applications.
